<p>
	In Fall 2017, Narrative Scienceâ€™s marketing team began an initiative to improve customer support across our platforms -- this included updating and creating support materials and hosting them in a help center on ZenDesk. 
</p>
<p>
	Following disappointing design deliverables from an contracted outside design firm, I became the internal design point person for this initiative. Using my past experience building a custom-themed support site on top of a CMS and my technical understanding of our products, I not only devised a scalable structure for the support site, but revised marketing copy, and designed and built a custom theme from scratch. 
</p>
<p>
	My contribution to this initiative not only made customer support more scalable and reliable across our enterprise partners, but reduced friction between our professional services team and our customers.
