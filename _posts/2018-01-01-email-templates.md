<div class="marker-post-heading"></div>
<p>
	In Fall of 2015, we launched a lifecycle email campaign at Seelio as part of an effort to improve on-site engagement. The campaign included a plan to not only revamp all existing emails, but to launch multiple sets of new emails, including Welcome, Trigger, Milestone, and Tip emails--each intended for a different phase of the customer journey. As the point-person for this project, I was in charge of everything from research to organization, design, development, and launch.
