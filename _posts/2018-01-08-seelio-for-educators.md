<p>
	Seelio for Educators is an educational technology that helps teachers and administrators of our partner universities track portfolio-based assignments, easily interact with students, and showcase exemplary student work through custom-curated showcases. Created to complement a university's Learning Management System (LMS), Seelio's educational platform flexibly caters to each university’s unique hierarchical system while also maintaining a streamlined simplicity.

	<p>
		We employed a service design approach to understanding exactly what educators wanted from an online educational tool like Seelio. After conducting interviews with new and existing users, we created primary, secondary, and tertiary educator personas and user scenarios.
	</p>
	<div class="post__quote">
		<ul>
			<li>“I expected the interface to have more back-end, admin-like features. I’m not really sure if what I’m looking at is what students are looking.” - User 4</li>
			<li>“I use the showcase as a repository of works for current and prospective students, for the dean, and for advising appointments”  - User 3</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

        <p class="post__lightbox__close">&#x2715;</p>
        <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img-asset-6j.png">
    </a>
	<p>
		We used our personas and scenarios to map out the educator journey across Seelio, to pinpoint areas of pain, and to identify service gaps that needed to be filled.

		From journey mapping, we discovered that most faculty were easily able to grasp the value of Seelio as an experiential learning tool. However, when it came to launching Seelio in the classroom, they felt unsure of how to incorporate the technology into their syllabi and preferred to rely on the Seelio staff for classroom introductions and technological support.

	<h3 class="heading heading--fancy">Innovating to fill in the gaps</h3>
	<p>
		While journey mapping helped us define a vision of an overall redesign, creating a user task flow helped us interject the user into the system in a more concrete way.
	</p>
	<p>
		To prioritize our design, we identified three main tasks we wanted users to complete:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Track and sort student works</li>
		<li>Give feedback to students on works</li>
		<li>Curate works into a custom showcase</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		With these tasks in mind, we conducted several rounds of brainstorming and ideation, from which we were able to abstract key concepts and ideas and create paper prototypes. Following a few rounds of informal testing and qualitative data analysis, we were able to develop three sets of interactive prototypes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Formal testing revealed that educators were used to more traditional web interfaces and preferred performing tedious tasks on familiar interfaces over learning to navigate new layouts. Although we did not intend for Seelio to become an LMS, we realized that it was imperative that we include familiar LMS keywords such as “Assignment” and “Grade.” 
	</p>
	<p>
		Following several rounds of testing, debriefing, and design iteration, we were able to consolidate our prototypes to one final design.

		Over the course of a few weeks, I designed a complete set of responsive, hi-fidelity mockups using Adobe Photoshop CS6. I communicated the designs and interactions to our development team using Trello, Google Docs, and Invision.
