		Seelio for Educators is an educational technology that helps teachers and administrators of our partner universities track portfolio-based assignments, easily interact with students, and showcase exemplary student work through custom-curated showcases. Created to complement a university's Learning Management System (LMS), Seelio's educational platform flexibly caters to each universityâ€™s unique hierarchical system while also maintaining a streamlined simplicity.
