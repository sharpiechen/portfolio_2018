<p>
	Data is being collected by companies daily and is an essential component to strategic growth. However, the average business manager does not have the resources to quickly make data-driven decisions. The goal of the Talos initiative is to provide a self-service tool that uses data to intelligently generate interactive reports at scale. By instantly surfacing key insights in plain language, Talos equips consumers at every level of an organization with the information necessary to make data-driven decisions.

	<p>
		Talos was launched in the winter of 2017 with the goal of designing, building, and launching a product by the end of 2018. Given our rigorous timeline, we wanted to follow a lean UX approach to product design and development by making mistakes and quickly learning from those mistakes through quick iterations.
		<br>
		<br>
		Using data collected from existing customers of other products in Narrative Science’s portfolio, we had already begun to identify a prevalent business problem: that companies were not using the mass amount of data they were collecting daily to its fully extent. Further observation of potential and existing customers not only validated this initial assertion, but uncovered specific customer concerns.
		<br>
		<br>
		With our potential users’ pain points in mind, we listed out our key assumptions and How Might We (HMW) questions to explicitly set a scope on our product goals:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Business managers rely heavily on business analysts to package data into reports and Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards. However, business analysts are often strapped for time and do not have the resources to manually create custom reports for business managers. <i>How might we allow business analysts to deliver actionable insights to business managers at scale?</i></li>
		<li>Data packaged as BI dashboards are tailored towards analysts and not the end-user; business people have trouble translating the predominantly visual output into actionable insights. <i>How might we ensure that business people are receiving actionable insights in a digestible way?</i></li>
		<li>Business managers want to dive deeper into insights but must rely on business analysts to do so -- a process that is often inefficient and time-consuming. <i>How might we empowers business people to dive deeper to into their insights?</i></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We bubbled up our learnings into three user archetypes:
	</p>
	<p>
		Charting the behaviors, motivations, and pain points of our users as archetypes helped us empathize with our end user and determine the lens through which we would approach our user experience.

	<h3 class="heading heading--fancy">Innovating to fill in the gaps</h3>
	<p>
		Using our HMW questions, I led the product team through a number of sessions during which I encouraged team members to divergently brainstorm ideas. We developed the following hypotheses from an amalgamation of product team ideas:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We believe that a data ingestion experience with basic extract, load, and transform (ETL) capabilities will allow a data steward to seamlessly load the necessary data into Talos for story configuration.</li>
		<li>We believe that an ontology mapping experience in Talos will allow business analysts to connect columns within their data to entities in Talos’ ontology, thus leveraging and building upon Talos’ intelligent knowledge base.</li>
		<li>We believe that a simple story configuration experience that intelligently yields insightful data-driven language will allow business analysts quickly package insights at scale.</li>
		<li>We believe that an interactive consumer experience will empower business managers to quickly discover their own insights without having to rely on business analysts.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Our hypotheses helped us identify the major touchpoints of the platform we would need to build out in order to provide business analysts with the basic functionality needed to configure a story. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Following several rounds of rapid prototyping, wireframe development, iteration, and informal user testing with potential customers, we designed and developed an end-to-end product that demonstrated the functionality of Talos at the most foundational level.

	<h3 class="heading heading--fancy">An interactive consumer experience</h3>
	<p>
		Work on Talos in the first half of 2018 has resulted in an end-to-end version of Talos Alpha as well as the delivery of pixel-perfect mockups for the Beta iteration of Talos.
		<br>
		<br>
		Upon completion of Talos Beta in Fall 2018, we’ll be launching a Beta program to evaluate product value and identify usability pain points. We’ll do so by collecting and assessing qualitative and quantitative data from user testing, surveys, and analytics to inform our next iteration of assumptions and eventually our product.

<ul>
	<li>Using previous UX experience, assumed the role of a design thought leader by educating the product team on best practices for user interviews, information synthesis, and idea generation.</li>
	<li>Helped push user research initiatives by reviewing research questions, sitting in on numerous user research interviews and synthesizing research notes. Created user research collateral such as journey maps, personas, and user flows.</li>
	<li>Developed and presented three visual concepts for Talos using a <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/4D3I948CJPR/">mood board in InVision</a> to various members of Talos’ product, engineering, and executive team. Following feedback, established a complete visual identity for Talos.</li>
	<li>Worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewjadams3/">Andrew Adams</a> to create a living style guide.</li>
	<li>Worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maia-lewis-meza/">Maia Lewis Meza</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewjadams3/">Andrew Adams</a>s to develop end-to-end wireframes and pixel-perfect mockups in Sketch for Talos Alpha and Beta.</li>
	<li>Communicated design specifications and interactions to product owners and engineering team using Google Docs and InVision.</li>
