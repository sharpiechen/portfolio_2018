	Data is being gathered by companies daily and is an essential component to growth. However, the average business person does not have the resources to quickly make data-driven decisions. The goal of the Talos initiative is to provide an intelligent self-service tool that uses data to generate interactive stories at scale. By instantly surfacing key insights in plain language, Talos equips consumers at every level of an organization with the information necessary to make data-driven decisions.
