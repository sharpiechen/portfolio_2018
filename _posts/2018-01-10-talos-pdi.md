<p>
	Data is being collected by companies daily and is an essential component to strategic growth. However, the average business manager does not have the resources to quickly make data-driven decisions. The goal of the Talos initiative is to provide a self-service tool that uses data to intelligently generate interactive reports at scale. By instantly surfacing key insights in plain language, Talos equips consumers at every level of an organization with the information necessary to make data-driven decisions.

	<p>
		Talos was launched in the winter of 2017 with the goal of designing, building, and launching a product by the end of 2018. Given our rigorous timeline, we wanted to follow a lean UX approach to product design and development by making mistakes quickly and quickly learning from those mistakes.
		<br>
		Using data collected from existing customers of other products in Narrative Science’s portfolio, we had already begun to identify a prevalent business problem: companies were gathering mass amounts of data daily but not using it to its fullest extent. Further observation of potential and existing customers not only validated this initial assertion, but uncovered specific customer concerns.
		<br>
		With our potential users’ pain points in mind, we listed out our key assumptions and How Might We (HMW) questions to explicitly set a scope on our product goals:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Business managers rely heavily on business analysts to package data into reports and Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards. However, business analysts are often strapped for time and do not have the resources to manually create custom reports for business managers. How might we allow business analysts to deliver actionable insights to business people at scale?</li>
		<li>Data packaged as BI dashboards are tailored towards analysts and not the end-user; business people have trouble translating the predominantly visual output into actionable insights. How might we ensure that business people are receiving actionable insights in a digestible way?</li>
		<li>Business managers want to dive deeper into insights but must rely on business analysts to do so -- a process that is often inefficient and time-consuming. How might we empowers business people to dive deeper to learn more about their insights?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We bubbled up our learnings into three user archetypes:
	</p>
	<p>
		Charting the behaviors, motivations, and pain points of our users as archetypes helped us empathize with our end-user and determine the lens through which we would approach our user experience.

	<h3 class="heading heading--fancy">Innovating to fill in the gaps</h3>
	<p>
		While journey mapping helped us define a vision of an overall redesign, creating a user task flow helped us interject the user into the system in a more concrete way.
	</p>
	<p>
		To prioritize our design, we identified three main tasks we wanted users to complete:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Track and sort student works</li>
		<li>Give feedback to students on works</li>
		<li>Curate works into a custom showcase</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		With these tasks in mind, we conducted several rounds of brainstorming and ideation, from which we were able to abstract key concepts and ideas and create paper prototypes. Following a few rounds of informal testing and qualitative data analysis, we were able to develop three sets of interactive prototypes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Formal testing revealed that educators were used to more traditional web interfaces and preferred performing tedious tasks on familiar interfaces over learning to navigate new layouts. Although we did not intend for Seelio to become an LMS, we realized that it was imperative that we include familiar LMS keywords such as “Assignment” and “Grade.” 
	</p>
	<p>
		Following several rounds of testing, debriefing, and design iteration, we were able to consolidate our prototypes to one final design.

		Over the course of a few weeks, I designed a complete set of responsive, hi-fidelity mockups using Adobe Photoshop CS6. I communicated the designs and interactions to our development team using Trello, Google Docs, and Invision.

<h4 class="heading heading--regular heading--emphasize post__heading--stacked">my role</h4>
<div class="marker-post-heading"></div>
<ul>
	<li>Using previous UX experience, assumed the role of a design thought leader by educating the product team on best practices for user interviews, information synthesis, and idea generation.</li>
	<li>Helped push user research initiatives by reviewing research questions, sitting in on numerous user research interviews and synthesizing research notes. Created user research collateral such as journey maps, personas, and user flows.</li>
	<li>Developed and presented three visual concepts for Talos using a mood board in InVision to various members of Talos’ product, engineering, and executive team. Following feedback, established a complete visual identity for Talos.</li>
	<li>Worked with Andrew Adams to create a living style guide.</li>
	<li>Worked with Maia Lewis Meza and Andrew Adams to develop end-to-end wireframes and pixel-perfect mockups in Sketch for Talos Alpha and Beta.</li>
	<li>Communicated design specifications and interactions to product owners and engineering team using Google Docs and InVision.</li>
