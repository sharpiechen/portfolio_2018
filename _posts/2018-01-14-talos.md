<div class="marker-post-heading"></div>
<p>
	Data is being collected by companies daily and is an essential component to strategic growth. However, the average business manager does not have the resources to quickly make data-driven decisions. The goal of this initiative is to provide businesses with a self-service tool that uses data to intelligently generate interactive stories at scale. By instantly surfacing key insights in plain language, the platform equips information consumers at every level of an organization with the insights necessary to make data-driven decisions.
