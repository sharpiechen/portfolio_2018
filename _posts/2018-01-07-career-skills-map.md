<p>
	Universities are struggling to provide students with a return on investment (ROI) that can support enrollment and retention. Following interviews with career center advisors, recruiters, and students, we found that not only are students graduating unprepared for the real world, but are completely unaware of the Career Center resources available to them. Seelioâ€™s Skills Map is a beta extension that helps students understand, build, and track the eight 21st century skills employers want but struggle to find in potential candidates.
