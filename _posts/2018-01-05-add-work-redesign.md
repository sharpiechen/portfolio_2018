	Seelio is an educational technology company that offers students a better way to showcase their work via online portfolios. Its Add Work feature is a critical touchpoint in the student experience and was the next feature, following the student profile redesign, to be updated in a post-beta improvement initiative. Following a complete redesign, Seelioâ€™s Add Work now matches the aesthetic of the student profile, is far more streamlined, and offers students tangible examples to reference at every point of interaction.
