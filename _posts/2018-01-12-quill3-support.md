<h4 class="heading heading--regular heading--emphasize">overview</h4>
<div class="marker-post-heading"></div>
<p>
	In Fall 2017, Narrative Scienceâ€™s marketing team began an initiative to improve customer support across our platforms -- this included updating and creating support materials and hosting them in a help center on ZenDesk. 
	<br>
	<br>
	As the design point person for this initiative, I combined my past experience building a custom-themed support site on top of my CMS and my technical understanding of our products to develop a scalable theme structure and design. Finally, I developed the theme in ZenDesk and delivered it to the professional services and marketing teams. The ZenDesk theme has since been copied and used across various Narrative Science products. 
	<br>
	<br>
	My contribution to this initiative not only made customer support more scalable and reliable across our enterprise partners, but reduced friction between our professional services team and our customers.
