<div class="marker-post-heading"></div>
<p>
	Data is being collected by companies daily and is an essential component to strategic growth. However, the average business manager does not have the resources to quickly make data-driven decisions. The goal of the Talos initiative is to provide businesses with a self-service tool that uses data to intelligently generate interactive reports at scale. By instantly surfacing key insights in plain language, Talos equips information consumers at every level of an organization with the insights necessary to make data-driven decisions.
