<h3 class="heading heading--fancy">A tool for students to showcase experiences and accomplishments</h3>
<p>
	Seelio is a educational technology startup that offers college students a better way to showcase their work via online portfolios which employers and recruiters alike can browse through and search by keyword.
</p>
<p>
	Since Seelio’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/06/no-more-boring-resumes-seelio-lets-college-students-showcase-their-work-helps-employers-find-them/">beta launch in August of 2012</a>, the student profile had not been updated and was in need of a redesign. Following a complete rework, the student profile now offers a more professional and modern aesthetic, a flexible layout for works, and customizable fields for about information.

	<h3 class="heading heading--fancy">Facilitating a dialogue with our power users</h3>
	<p>
		Initial interviews with power users showed that three motivating factors for using Seelio were:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>to track and show off their accomplishments</li>
		<li>to avoid having to work with other cumbersome website tools that might require coding or design skills</li>
		<li>to see what similar students from other campuses were doing</li>
	</ul>
    <a href="#img12b">
        <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img-asset-12b.jpeg" alt="image" class="post__asset">
    </a>
	<a href="#_" class="post__lightbox" id="img12b">
        <!-- <p class="post__lightbox__close">&#x2715;</p> -->
        <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img-asset-12b.jpeg">
    </a>
	<p>
		Though students seemed to appreciate Seelio’s simplicity and ease-of-use, they expressed a consensual desire for added customization. 
	</p>
	<div class="post__quote">
		<ul>
			<li>“I’m only interested in seeing people in my network’s works — mechanical engineers, upperclassmen. The other day, I thought one person’s project was really cool and checked out which class he was taking” — Student 2</li>
			<li>“I tend to apply to a wide array of jobs that they think they might be able to do, hoping that recruiters will be attracted to at least one of their skills sets. I have a wide range of skills and would like to be able to create multiple types of portfolios” — Student 6</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>In addition to user interviews, we also collected a significant amount of design feedback from bug submissions, User Voice suggestions, and surveys. We compiled our findings to draw out common themes and created three student personas from which we could reference while creating our designs.
	</p>
    <a href="#img12c">
        <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img-asset-12c.png" alt="image" class="post__asset">
    </a>
	<a href="#_" class="post__lightbox" id="img12c">
        <!-- <p class="post__lightbox__close">&#x2715;</p> -->
        <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img-asset-12c.png">
    </a>
	<h4 class="heading heading--regular heading--emphasize post__heading--stacked">create & test</h4>
	<div class="marker-post-heading"></div>
	<h3 class="heading heading--fancy">Collecting feedback at all stages</h3>
	<p>
		With the findings from our various sources in mind, we developed three sets of paper prototypes to gauge reactions to different layouts and features such as a cover photo and timeline view.
	</p>
    <a href="#img12d">
        <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img-asset-12d.jpeg" alt="image" class="post__asset">
    </a>
	<a href="#_" class="post__lightbox" id="img12d">
        <!-- <p class="post__lightbox__close">&#x2715;</p> -->
        <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img-asset-12d.jpeg">
    </a>
    <p>While we wanted to maximize our redesign and account for all user suggestions and issues, we were determined not to lose sight of our overall vision. Many users were comparing us to website-building sites such as Squarespace, Weebly, and Wix and expressed a desire for similar themes and flexibility. However, we felt as though too much customization might compromise some of Seelio’s simplicity and ease-of-use.
	</p>
    <a href="#img12e">
        <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img-asset-12e.jpeg" alt="image" class="post__asset">

    <a href="#img12f">

    <p>
    	To test our paper prototypes, we sent out surveys, conducted one-on-one testing, informal card sorting, and focus group testing testing sessions. All user testing data was recorded in Google Docs. We created affinity walls for all data, rearranged, and regrouped sticky notes to identify common themes.
    </p>
	<div class="post__quote">
		<ul>
			<li>“I’d like some specific prompts for the About Me section. I don’t really know what to put in there — it’s just a big empty box.” I think every part of the profile should have placeholders so I have a starting point” — Student 1</li>
			<li>“I don’t like the timeline. There is very little control over what is showing. I don’t think I could differentiate myself based on a timeline — it’s too hard to customize.” — Student 5</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>
		After consolidating our paper concepts to a single prototype, I designed a complete set of responsive, hi-fidelity mockups using Adobe Photoshop CS6. I communicated the designs specifications and interactions to our development team using Trello and Google Documents.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before releasing our new design to all students, we initiated a soft release to power users who had given us feedback during our testing sessions. We set up a Google Group and over the course of two weeks, monitored forums, initiated dialogue, and compiled additional feedback. The Google Group was invaluable in helping us identify and tweak small details and bugs.

	<div class="marker-post-heading"></div>
	<h3 class="heading heading--fancy">Digital customization within a professional context</h3>
	<p>
		The redesign of Seelio’s student profile offers users added customization within a professional space. Though we wanted to students to distinguish themselves using their profiles, we also wanted to keep profile layouts consistent so audiences could easily view information. Features such as a profile cover photo and work cover photos add fun visual elements without compromising the organization and flow of the design.
	</p>
	<p>
		Keeping in line with the professional element of the profile, we expanded the about section to include common resume fields such as relevant classes and skills. Students also now have the option of linking their resume and various other social networks to create a holistic digital identity that showcases not only what they can do but who they are.
