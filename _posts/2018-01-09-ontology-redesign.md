	Design thinking is a key component to the success of all companies and extends far beyond the design team. All components of the methodology, from identifying the solution and ideation, to creating hypotheses and prototyping an idea, ensure that a product or service is created for the intended end-user.
 	<br><br>
	Design thinking helps companies understand that no design will be “right” the first time, but that following this solutions-based approach will ensure that with each incremental iteration, the design will become closer and closer to being what the user expects. Above all, it helps companies gain an empathetic understanding of the people who are using their products and services.
	<br><br>
	For over six years, I’ve been educating myself on and applying design thinking strategies to agile product development. I’ve learned that while it’s impossible to apply a comprehensive design approach to agile product development, it’s always possible to incorporate some level of design thinking to move the project forward. As I’ve shifted my mindset towards problem solving and learned to quickly adapt to new scenarios, I’ve begun to share my experiences with co-workers and other members of the design community. 
	<br><br>
	At Narrative Science, I’ve organized and led two product team design hackathons. During the hackathons, I taught product team members rapid brainstorming techniques and encouraged members to think beyond the features they focus on daily. The goal of these design hackathons was not necessarily to generate concrete ideas to incorporate into our product roadmap, but to prove that anyone can be designer and that even a low-fidelity prototype can act as a proof of concept.

	In addition to leading design hackathons, I’ve also given multiple presentations to the product team about how design works and best practices for working with designers. The goal of these presentations was to help product team members understand that making something look visually appealing is just the tip of the iceberg of what product designer are good at doing. It helped shift the mindset of members away from specific features and solutions, but back to the larger problem at hand.

<p>Outside of Narrative Science, I’ve also given various talks and about design, such as at <a href="http://2015.worldiaday.org/locations/ann-arbor-mi-united-states/">World IA Day</a> and at <a href="https://creativemornings.com/cities/chi">Creative Mornings</a> in Chicago, and have written <a href="https://medium.com/@sharingchen">several blog posts</a> about my experience with UI & UX design.</p>
