<p>
	In Fall 2017, Narrative Science’s marketing team began an initiative to improve customer support across our platforms -- this included updating and creating support materials and hosting them in a help center on ZenDesk. 
	<br>
	<br>
	As the design point person for this initiative, I combined my past experience building a custom-themed support site on top of my CMS and my technical understanding of our products to develop a scalable theme structure and design. Finally, I developed the theme in ZenDesk and delivered it to the professional services and marketing teams. The ZenDesk theme has since been copied and used across various Narrative Science products. 
	<br>
	<br>
	My contribution to this initiative not only made customer support more scalable and reliable across our enterprise partners, but increased customer satisfaction across Narrative Science’s products while minimizing the cost of in-person support.
